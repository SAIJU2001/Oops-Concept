/*
 * We cound not write any Destructor.
 * java should have own gurbage collector.
 * when any method or class unused in the program then the method or class goes to the     gurbage collector.
 * Destructor is opposite of constructor to make the balance
 * Destructor or gurbage collector works automatically that's why java is very efficient
